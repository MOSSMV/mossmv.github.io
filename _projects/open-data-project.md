# data-mv

This project aims to make better tools for visualization of data of Maldives. We expect data to come in any format: text, csv, xls, pdf, word and in any language and we plan to make scripts to convert this data in to a web friendly format and also give APIs

# technology

The scripting is undecided (preferably python) and the site will initially generated using simple cgi scripts without any back-end framework. Currently we are collecting data. We plan to shift this to databases at a later point with API access.
