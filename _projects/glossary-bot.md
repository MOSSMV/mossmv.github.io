# Glossary Bot
This is a simple web app designed to be used as a Telegram integration. Specifically, it responds to POSTs created by the Telegram *Commands* integration and responds with messages to Telegrams's *Incoming Webhooks* integration.

Glossary Bot maintains a glossary of terms created by its users, and responds to requests with definitions.
